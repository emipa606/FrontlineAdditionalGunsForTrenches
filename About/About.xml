FRONTLINE - Additional Guns:

Adding 3 new machine guns with new sounds (extracted from wartime recordings):
- Lewis Gun
- DP 1928
- Browning M2

All of these guns work with the FRONTLINE - Trenches.
These new guns take less time to reload / aka shoot again, but got less bullets per burst. So they can select a new target faster, but the traditional guns (MG 08/15, MG-34, MG-42) spam more bullets for supression. Choice is yours!

Hope you enjoy it, feel free to leave a comment!

IMPORTANT: Load Additional guns after Trenches.
